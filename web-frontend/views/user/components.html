                            <p>This will probably be the largest section of your guidelines. It covers a wide range of topics covering how the code you write interacts with the rest of the environment. If the previous section covered *how* you code, this section covers *what* you code.</p>
                            <p>From the moment your service starts up, it’s going to need to be need information to configure itself. Standard configuration file locations and formats, as well and guides for naming command line flags are useful. Does your service need to reload its configuration in-place while still running, or a graceful restart while not dropping network connections? Should you aim for graceful-shutdowns or crash-only with recovery on startup?</p>

                            <p>Once your service is up and running, how does it communicate with other services? Does it need to contact a directory service? What about service authentication? Does it speak JSON over HTTP(S) or something else? What should the retry strategy be? How does it handle API versioning? And all of these need to be answered for the service as a client and a server.</p>
                            <p>Finally, how do you report to the rest of the world what’s happening? At the bare minimum, what are the policies around logging and metrics? For logs, what should be logged and where does it go? Are the logs structured for free-form? If using structured logs, what are the naming guidelines for common fields? Do you have different logging verbosity levels? If so, what are they and what should be logged at each level? Metrics again need a common destination and consistent guidelines around what to track and what to name them. How are distributed traces collected?</p>

                            <p>As this was all basically greenfield and I was on my own at the start. Part of it clarifying what development was like on the Go side of things (also for advocacy purposes — “Come play with our nice tools!”), but at the same time making clear my expectations for code people commited. This mostly covered differences from the development processes that the company had deemed acceptable for the multi-million line Perl codebase.</p>
                            <p>I spent a lot of time looking for best practices from similar organizations, with rationales if possible so that I could see if their goals matched mine. For example, people often point to Google engineering practices and try to imitate them and apply them to their own organization. But lots of practices that make sense at Google do not make sense in other organizations. You can not just absorb another company’s guidelines wholesale without taking their assumptions about their culture and associated infrastructure. (I might explore this more in another blog post I’m tentatively calling “The parable of glog”.)</p>
